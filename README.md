# Optimization_Collective_IO_MPI

This repository contains:

- C program that I have implemented myself,
*benchmark-IO.c*, which is the parallel IO version of BIPS3D simulator software. More information at [Optimization and evaluation of parallel I/O in BIPS3D paral
lel irregular application](http://www.arcos.inf.uc3m.es/~desingh/papers/2007/2007PMEO.pdf) 

- The *aggregation_pattern.c*, which is the library used for optimizing the IO collective operations. This library has two aggregation patterns for the Two_Phase IO.
